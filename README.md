# BuildingSAM
BuildingSAM is a processing pipeline for 3-channel remote sensing data, paired with a pre-trained Segment Anything Model (SAM) LoRA-Adapter optimized for building detection in aerial imagery with a 10-50cm (30cm best) Ground Sampling Distance (GSD). The pipeline is fully configurable via a YAML file for reproducibility and ease of use.
